# Lyna

A Discord.js bot for moderation, role management, and other admin tasks, built for Rainbow Materia.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

* A copy of Node.js `15.x` or newer installed
* A Discord application from the [Discord developer dashboard](https://discord.com/developers), with a configured bot user.

## Installing

To get started, first copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Then, open the new `.env` file and fill in the options:

* **DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN**: Your Discord bot's token (not the client ID or secret), accessible from the [Discord developer dashboard](https://discord.com/developers).

Once this is done, execute `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm run start` to start up the bot.
